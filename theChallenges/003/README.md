# Euler challenge 3

``` 
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

```

## Lessons learned:
* Dont throw away code? I happened to have prime finding programs from way back; they were easy to adapt to this (although the program itself is too heavy).
* One neednt optimize all the way.  When it reaches 210, the Wheel object can be rebuilt to quickly eliminate even more of the candidate numbers.  But that code is a bit complex and tricky, so I didnt feel like bringing it in for this.
* The #s of solvers keep declining, slowly.
