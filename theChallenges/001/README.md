# Euler challenge 1

```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

## Lessons learned:
* Dont go complex.  These challenges (at first anyway) dont need or want the usual surroundings of Java programs.  So I carved all that away.
* Solve everything twice.  I did a simple algorithm, and one more complex, but (maybe) more efficient.  I had to fix the complex one three times.
