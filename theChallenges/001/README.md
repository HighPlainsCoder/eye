Euler challenge 1

Lessons learned:
* Dont go complex.  These challenges (at first anyway) dont need or want the usual surroundings of Java programs.  So I carved all that away.
* Solve everything twice.  I did a simple algorithm, and one more complex, but (maybe) more efficient.  I had to fix the complex one three times.
