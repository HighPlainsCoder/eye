# Euler challenge 10

``` 
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```

## Lessons learned:
* primes again.  I could share much of the prime code as a library, but for this, I prefer to keep each solution self-contained.
* Sum is not Product. They're not the same. They're different.
