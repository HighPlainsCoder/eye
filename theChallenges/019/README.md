# Euler challenge 19



You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
    Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?


## Notes

* dates are hard, as we know.
* date libraries are handy, but thats against the spirit here.

## Lessons learned

* Off by 1 errors we will always have. I had 2.
* My IDE is rusty and needs a good talking to.
