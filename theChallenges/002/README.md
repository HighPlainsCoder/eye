# Euler challenge 2

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

## Lessons learned:
* Even a tiny class like fibonacci makes things easier
* Since I only need every 3rd value, I could make a new sequence that is just "even fibonacci numbers" but its hard to work out the sequence.  Damnit, I couldnt stop myself.
* Eventually, probably, being able to derive more efficient functions ('classes') will become useful; maybe even necessary.
