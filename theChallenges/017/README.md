# Euler challenge 17

I didnt like challenge 17, so I didnt do it.  This is playtime; Im allowed.

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
