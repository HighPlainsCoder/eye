#Euler challenge 6

``` 
 The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
          1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
       (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```

##Lessons learned

* Apparently, some people say "difference between A and B" and dont mean "A - B"; they mean "B - A", or maybe "|A - B|"
* how long as it been since I used |expression| to means absolute value? Too long; all the "or" partisans have hijacked that symbol.
